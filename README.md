# 🚉 Railway Station Connectivity Framework

This project simulates a networked communication infrastructure between multiple railway stations using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It was developed as part of the **Data Communication and Computer Networks (DCCN)** course in the 2nd Year, 1st Semester.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Railway Station Connectivity Framework** models how communication systems between different railway stations can be established and managed using networking principles. Each station operates as a separate network segment, connected to others through routers. The simulation illustrates routing, IP addressing, subnetting, and data transfer across nodes.

## ⚙️ Features & Operations

### 🛰️ Station Architecture
Each station includes:
- A **router** (for external communication)
- A **switch** (for internal device communication)
- Multiple **end devices** (PCs for ticketing, operations, etc.)

### 🌐 IP Addressing & Subnetting
- Each station is assigned a unique subnet
- Proper subnet planning ensures efficient address usage and communication isolation

### 🔁 Static Routing
- Configured static routes enable manual control over packet forwarding between stations
- Ensures accurate and deterministic routing paths

### 📡 End-to-End Communication
- Devices at one station can communicate with devices at another station
- Ping tests confirm successful data transmission across the network

### 💡 Visualization & Simulation
- Users can watch packets traverse the network using **Simulation Mode**
- Network topology, addressing, and flow are clearly visualized in the Packet Tracer file

## 📁 Project File

- `DCCN Project Railway Station Network.pkt`:  DCCN Project Railway Station Network.pkt
  
   The main Cisco Packet Tracer file containing:
  - Full topology of interconnected stations
  - Configured routers, IPs, and devices
  - Ready-to-run simulation with pre-defined routes and connectivity

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer** (v7.2 or later recommended)
2. Explore the topology and inspect device configurations
3. Switch to **Simulation Mode** to:
   - Monitor packet flow between stations
   - Validate routing and connectivity
4. Use the `ping` command on PCs to test communication between stations
